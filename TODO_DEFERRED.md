# Deferred Issues

- **sphinx.py**: Verify the Sphinx extension still works with current Sphinx. (Optional deps now declared; functional test still needed.)
- **README badges**: Add badges similar to `unpythonic`/`mcpyrate` (Python version, PyPI, etc.). Also announce Claude-assisted revival after completing the recon plan steps.
- **Dependabot**: GitHub reports 4 high-severity vulnerabilities on the default branch. Review at https://github.com/Technologicat/pyan/security/dependabot and update affected deps.
