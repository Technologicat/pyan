# Deferred TODOs

Items with GitHub ticket numbers are tracked externally. The rest are internal notes.

## "Node" terminology overload

Three concepts share the name "node": (1) AST node (`ast.AST`), (2) Pyan's analysis graph node (`Node` class), (3) visualization/output node. Consider introducing distinct terminology.

## Edge confidence scoring

Determine confidence of detected edges. See [DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md).

## Improved wildcard resolution

Partly addressed by #88 fix (import-aware expansion). Remainder: see [johnyf/pyan#5](https://github.com/johnyf/pyan/issues/5).

## Type inference for function arguments

Would reduce wildcard noise by resolving argument types at call sites. Ambitious.

## Tuples/lists as first-class values

`x = [a, b, c]` overapproximates via Cartesian fallback. Would need flow-sensitive analysis.

## Subscript assignment

`ast.Subscript` in assignment targets — binding information not recorded.

## Additional unpacking generalizations (PEP 448)

`{**a, **b}`, `[*a, *b]` — uses detected, bindings not recorded.

## Resolving function call results

Return type tracking beyond the `super()` special case.

## Per-namespace `resolve_imports`

Global IMPORTEDITEM remapping can leak function-level imports to siblings. Partially mitigated by `_has_import_to()` in `expand_unknowns`.

## Document the visitor-to-visgraph protocol

`VisualGraph.from_visitor` expects an implicit protocol (`nodes`, `uses_edges`, `defines_edges`). Should be documented or formalized.

## Test suite organization

Tests are spread across few modules (`test_features.py`, `test_regressions.py`, `test_modvis.py`, `test_writers.py`, `test_analyzer.py`, `test_sphinx.py`, `test_coverage.py`). Consider reorganizing by concern — e.g. separate CLI tests from unit tests, group by module under test.

## Analyzer module split

`analyzer.py` is ~2200 lines. Consider splitting into submodules (e.g. visitors, postprocessing, scope handling) without changing the public API.

## Type annotations for pyan's own code

Add type annotations to pyan's modules. The analyzer is the largest target (~2200 lines). Would improve IDE support and catch bugs.

## Audit typing: abstract parameter types, concrete return types

Parameters should use abstract types from `collections.abc` (`Mapping`, `Sequence`, `Iterable`) for widest-possible-accepted semantics. Return types should use concrete lowercase builtins (`tuple[int, int]`, `list[int]`, `dict[str, int]`) — PEP 585, Python 3.9+. The capitalized `typing` forms (`Dict`, `List`, `Tuple`) are deprecated aliases for the builtins and offer no extra width — avoid them. Audit existing type hints across the codebase for consistency.

Discovered during raven-cherrypick compare mode planning (2026-03-30).
